## Proposed Improvements

### Priority 1: High Impact — Untested Core Logic

#### 1. Proxy dedup modes: `skip` and `append` (proxy.go:344-358)

Only `overwrite` dedup is tested. The `skip` and `append` branches in
`generateFilename` are completely untested. These are user-facing features
with distinct behavior:

- **`skip`**: Uses `filepath.Glob` to check for existing files; returns `""`
  to signal skipping. Should verify that: (a) first capture writes a file,
  (b) second capture of the same route is skipped, (c) different routes are
  still captured.
- **`append`**: Uses an internal counter map to generate unique filenames.
  Should verify that: (a) first capture uses a base filename, (b) subsequent
  captures append an incrementing counter, (c) different routes maintain
  independent counters.

#### 2. `watchCoats` event loop (serve.go:104-156, currently 48.4%)

The file watcher's event loop is the lowest-covered non-main function. Key
untested branches:

- **Write/Create events on a coat file** — verify that `srv.Reload` is called
  with newly loaded coats when a `.yaml` file is modified.
- **Remove events** — verify reload triggers when a coat file is deleted.
- **Non-coat file changes** — verify that changes to non-`.yaml`/`.json` files
  are ignored (the `IsCoatFile` guard).
- **Watcher error channel** — verify that errors from `watcher.Errors` are
  logged and don't crash the watcher.
- **Load errors during reload** — verify that validation errors during reload
  are logged as warnings and the server continues operating.

#### 3. `resolveBodyFile` ambiguity detection (server.go:247-270, 83.3%)

The function attempts to detect which coat file a `body_file` is relative to
when multiple coat files define coats with the same name/URI/method. The
ambiguity branch is not directly tested. Should verify:

- Two coat files with the same coat name/URI/method but different `body_file`
  values — the function should fall back and not resolve the file.
- Single coat with `body_file` across multiple files — no ambiguity, resolves
  correctly.

### Priority 2: Medium Impact — Error Paths, Edge Cases, and TLS

#### 4. TLS configuration and error handling

TLS is currently tested only on the happy path (valid self-signed cert →
successful HTTPS request). Several important scenarios are missing:

**a. Invalid or mismatched cert/key files (server.go:77-80)**

`StartTLS` delegates to `http.Server.ServeTLS` which validates the cert/key
pair. The server goroutine logs the error but no test verifies the behavior:

- **Mismatched cert and key** — the cert was generated with a different key
  than the one provided. `ServeTLS` returns an error immediately. Verify
  the server fails to start or logs the mismatch error.
- **Corrupt PEM file** — a key file containing garbage data. Verify the error
  is surfaced.
- **Wrong PEM type** — e.g. a certificate file provided as the key argument
  and vice versa.

**b. Expired certificate handling**

Generate a cert with `NotAfter` in the past. The server will start (Go only
validates on handshake), but clients should receive a TLS handshake error.
Test that:

- The server starts without error.
- An HTTPS request from a client that checks expiry (default behavior)
  returns a `tls.CertificateExpiredError` or equivalent.
- The server itself remains running (doesn't crash).

**c. TLS via the public API (`trenchcoat.go`)**

The public `Server` type has no TLS support — there is no `StartTLS` method
or `WithTLS` option. This means Go test suites using the programmatic API
cannot test HTTPS endpoints. Proposed additions:

- `WithTLS(certFile, keyFile string) Option` — configure TLS cert/key.
- Modify `Start(t)` to call `inner.StartTLS` when TLS is configured, and
  set `s.URL` to `https://...`.
- Alternatively, a simpler `WithSelfSignedTLS() Option` that generates an
  ephemeral self-signed cert at startup (useful for tests that just need
  HTTPS without caring about specific certs).
- Tests:
  - `TestWithTLS` — start server with TLS, make HTTPS request, verify body.
  - `TestWithSelfSignedTLS` — same, using auto-generated cert.
  - `TestStartTLS_InvalidCert` — verify `t.Fatal` is called on bad cert.

**d. TLS minimum version enforcement**

The server currently uses Go's default TLS config, which allows TLS 1.0+.
For security hardening, the server should enforce a minimum TLS version
(e.g. TLS 1.2). Test that:

- A TLS 1.2 client connects successfully.
- A TLS 1.1 client (if configured with `tls.Config{MaxVersion: tls.VersionTLS11}`)
  is rejected with a handshake error.

**e. Proxy mode TLS listener**

The proxy server (`internal/proxy`) only supports plain HTTP for its
listener. If the proxy itself should serve over HTTPS (e.g. for HTTPS proxy
testing), this is a feature gap rather than a test gap. At minimum, document
this limitation or add a `StartTLS` method to `Proxy`.

**f. CLI `--tls-cert`/`--tls-key` with non-existent files**

The CLI validates that both flags are provided together, but doesn't
validate that the files exist before passing them to `StartTLS`. A test
should verify that:

- `trenchcoat serve --tls-cert /nonexistent --tls-key /nonexistent` returns
  a clear error (currently fails inside `ServeTLS`).
- The error message includes the file path for debuggability.

#### 5. Gzip decompression errors in proxy capture (proxy.go:258-271)

Two error branches in `captureCoat` are untested:

- `gzip.NewReader` returns an error (e.g. response claims gzip but body is
  not valid gzip data).
- `io.ReadAll` on the gzip reader fails mid-stream.

Both should log errors and fall back to writing the raw (compressed) body.

#### 5. `shouldCapture` with invalid filter pattern (proxy.go:242-251, 71.4%)

When the `--filter` glob pattern is malformed (e.g. contains `[` without
closing `]`), `path.Match` returns an error. The function logs it and returns
`false`. This error path is not tested.

#### 6. `singleJoiningSlash` branch coverage (proxy.go:395-404, 66.7%)

This utility function has four branches for combining paths with/without
trailing/leading slashes. Only two branches are exercised. Add table-driven
tests covering all four combinations:

- `a/` + `/b` → `a/b` (both slashes — trim one)
- `a/` + `b` → `a/b` (only a has slash)
- `a` + `/b` → `a/b` (only b has slash)
- `a` + `b` → `a/b` (neither has slash — add one)

#### 7. Query matching edge cases (matcher.go:275-307)

- Multiple values for the same query param (e.g. `?tag=a&tag=b`): the matcher
  uses `r.URL.Query().Get()` which returns the first value. There's no test
  confirming this behavior.
- Query params with special characters in values (URL-encoded chars).
- Glob patterns in query value matching (e.g. `page: "*"`).

#### 8. Matcher precedence tie-breaking (matcher.go:216-235, 88.9%)

The `betterThan` function has a branch for equal scores + equal URI mode that
falls through to file-order precedence. This tie-breaking path is not
exercised by any test.

### Priority 3: Lower Impact — Hardening and Completeness

#### 9. Config file parsing errors (config.go)

No test covers what happens when a config file exists but contains invalid
YAML. Viper's behavior in this case should be verified (error returned vs
silent ignore).

#### 10. Public API with invalid coat files

`WithCoatFile` with a non-existent file or a file containing validation errors
— verify that errors are surfaced or handled gracefully. Currently the errors
from `LoadPaths` are stored but the public API's behavior is untested.

#### 11. Server with no coats handling requests

`NewServer()` with no options, then making HTTP requests — verify consistent
404 behavior with the expected JSON error body.

#### 12. Proxy redirect handling

The proxy uses `http.ErrUseLastResponse` to prevent following redirects, but
there are no tests verifying that 3xx responses are captured and relayed
as-is to the client.

#### 13. Concurrent requests during server reload

No test verifies correct behavior when requests arrive while `Reload` is
in progress. The server uses `sync.RWMutex` for this — a test should confirm
no races and that requests either see the old or new coats (never a partial
state).
